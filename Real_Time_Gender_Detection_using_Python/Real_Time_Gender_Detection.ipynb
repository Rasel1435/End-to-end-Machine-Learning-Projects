    "Gender detection is one of the popular computer vision applications. When you use a camera to detect a person’s gender instead of detecting it on a picture, it can be said to be a real-time gender detection system. So, if you want to learn how to create a real-time gender detection system, this article is for you. In this article, I’ll walk you through the task of real-time gender detection using Python."
