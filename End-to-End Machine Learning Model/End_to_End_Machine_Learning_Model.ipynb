    "An end-to-end machine learning model means that you train a model and deploy it into an end product or application where it can be used to add value to an organization. For example, when you train a model for the task of predicting stock prices, it cannot be said to be an end-to-end model. But if you build an app where you give a user input as the name of the stock or its symbol and get its future prices as output, this is an end-to-end model."

    "So we can say that if you build an application where you can test the predictions of your trained model, it is an end-to-end model. This is why having an end to end application in your data science resume strengthens your profile as it shows that you know how to train a model that can add value to an organization when deployed in the product or the final application. In the section below, I’ll walk you through how to build an end-to-end model using Python."
