    "To create an end-to-end application for the task of hate speech detection, you must first learn how to train a machine learning model to detect if there is hate speech in a piece of text. You can easily learn all about hate speech detection with machine learning from <a href=\"https://github.com/Rasel1435/Advanced-Data-Science-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Hate%20Speech%20Detection%20with%20Machine%20Learning/Hate_Speech_Detection_with_Machine_Learning.ipynb\">here</a>. To deploy this model as an end-to-end application, I will be using the streamlit library in Python which will help us see the predictions of the hate speech detection model in real-time. If you have never used the streamlit library before, you need to install it on your system using the pip command"
